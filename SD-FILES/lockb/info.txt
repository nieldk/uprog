Place the LOCKBITS files here. Text files with *.txt extension.

File construction:
01

Where 01 is LOCKBYTE value in HEX

See "example-lockbits.txt" for example.

Unused bits are always 1, see datasheet.
This is important to successfuly pass the veryfication.
For example, lockbyte-file for Atmega88 will contain as follows:
FC
(BIN=11111100, this will enable LB1 and LB2)
